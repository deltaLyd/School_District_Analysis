# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Curriculum Repository

**Purpose & Overview**: 
The purpose of this analysis is to correct altered reading and math grades in a school district's database, specifically those of 9th grade students at Thomas High School.
The school board wants to be able to uphold the state-testing standards, so they have turned to my client, Maria for help.  Maria has asked me to replace all the scores for 9th grade students at Thomas High School with "NaNs", essentially wiping those values from the broader dataset, so they are no longer improperly biasing the database.

I then reclaculate the passing percentages for students at Thomas High School without these erroneous scores, then re-run a prior analysis on the school district's database to understand how the elimination of this group changes the overall analysis.
